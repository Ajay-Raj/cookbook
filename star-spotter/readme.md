* Link each object to online databases such as: <http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/star-catalog/sao.html?

	* Tie movements to specific time periods and, for example, display the date of the current positions
	* Also be able to show apparent movement around Sol for any specific date
* Currently, color is tied to an arbitrary element. Future revisions
	* Tie color, size, alpha and other visual attributes to arbitrary star attributes as selected by the user
	* Needs default value is no data for a star of star data is a huge outlier
	* Needs to know the bell curve of typical values
* Permalink capability to provide ability to zoom to any star
* Link to and from scrollable/searchable ASCII table with the same data items
* Add Loevel of Detail and logarithmic zooming capabilities
