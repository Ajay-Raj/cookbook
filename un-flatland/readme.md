## Concept
The fastest, smallest sweetest 3D Map code you ever did see.

## Features

* Covers the world - matches Slippy Map
* Runs locally or from stitic file server
* Generic 3D library - can be used with other apps and libraries
* Very small file size ~ you can easily open up and start hacking
* Fast enough to be usable
* Easy to build your own place lists

Question: Can we get this down to 50 metre detail?

## System Requirements

The code on this site makes extensive use of the latest and most demanding Internet technologies - including HTML 5 and WebGL and HTML.

In order to view the files or run the apps on this web site you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/).
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Hardware: Generally WebGL support requires a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia or AMD. 
Successful use of the apps on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. A computer that is good for heavy gaming is a likely to be satisfactory.
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.

Browser Support: The apps here may work with the FireFox or Opera browsers, but most likely will not work with Safari or Internet Explorer. 
The apps here are currently being and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.
